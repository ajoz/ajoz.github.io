A while ago when I was searching youtube for some interesting TechTalks, I've stumbled upon a series of videos called "Is TTD dead?" from [ThoughtWorks](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQvdU25Eqk3YS9-QnILhKKQ) channel. And belive me, as a TDD believer this statement alone was an absolute *shock* for me. It made me think "is TDD really dead?" or maybe its innocent and we are hostages of current programming languages architecture?

It is splited in part talk between [David Hansson](http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Heinemeier_Hansson) (creator of Ruby on Rails), [Martin Fowler](http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Fowler) (best known for his books about Refactoring) and [Kent Beck](http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck) (who gave us Extreme Programming and Test Driven Development). They were discussing the problems created by TTD and that it has negative effect on the architecture we are creating. At first it was really a shock for me, how can anyone claim that TTD is bad and creates crappy software. In my everyday work I feel lack of testing and TTD, I feel I want / need more TTD then I get.

Before you read any of my thought, I recommend you to watch those videos:
