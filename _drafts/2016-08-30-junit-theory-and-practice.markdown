Maybe it's not a very polite thing but I would like to start with a small rant. I've read a lot of different articles about unit testing in `java` and all of them agreed on few simple rules:
- you should always test smallest things possible - so called `unit's`
- you should only test one thing at a time - no multiple `asserts` in one test
- you should test each valid case your software might encounter

All things fine, we can discuss about the definition of those points and the way they are phrased but in all essence they sound legit.

Article about using parametrized tests, junit theories. Comparing this solution with Spock and testing in Scala.

Show different approaches with Parametrized and Theory with the noifs match method as an example.
