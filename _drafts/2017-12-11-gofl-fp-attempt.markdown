Words matter! Matter a lot! This seems like a very obvious statement. Less obvious is that words are dangerous. Especially for a programmer! Words can be misleading, broad or narrow but most of all people understand them differently. This difference in understanding is the most important thing any programmer should know and care about.



It's been almost a month since the [Coderetreat](http://127.0.0.1:4000/2017/11/19/coderetreat-lodz-2017/) but I can't stop thinking about the sessions and solutions created for those.
