Words matter! Matter a lot! This seems like a very obvious statement. Less obvious is that words are dangerous. Especially for a programmer! Words can be misleading, can be broad or narrow but most of all, people tend to understand them differently. It doesn't matter which words, the confusion comes even with those used daily. This difference in understanding is the most important thing any programmer should know and care about.

- how hard is to comunicate
- we all understand the same words differently
- but we think that other people understand them in the same way
- math example about the definition of associativity and how its easy to loose your students
- operations can be done in any order
- why do people think about operands then?
- this confused me with commutativity
- we wanted a short elegant and concise definition but we got a confused student
- so maybe we need some further explanation then? so what is the worth of a definition if you need a separate explanation for it?
- Should all names be super descriptive or should one need to learn the meaning?
- Words confuse people because they are often lazy Cannoften use different word for the same thing at least they think about it as the same Great example is the word highway, there is also motorway, freeway They do mean different kind of road even in law but people often ten to converge the meaning to a bigger road with more lanes
- Is it a faulty word then?
