- the author constantly mentiones the idea of collective code ownership. Is this the correct solution?
- isn't collective code ownership lowering the code quality? from my own experience people forced to jump from file to file, from module to module feel less responsible for the changed code. In most cases when the codebase is extra large this is happening very often.
- I'm really disappointed with any "Agile" methodology, probably it's because those methodologies try to fight with basic human nature. I'm contrasting what Sandro wrote with articles on Bryan Edds blog on medium
- Bryan is describing a set of rules called by him "soverign development" which was observed in open source projects - one engaged person is better because it knows what is happening in the code and is caring about it.
- Sandro stresses the meaning of technical perfection
- I feel more responsible for a module that I wrote from scratch, I'm really suspicious to any change proposed by other people. I'm just proud of the achievment, should such feelings be nurtured?
- is Scrum the correct way? I heared it's a methodology of concultancy companies, conceived as a means of covering one's arse. Often consultancy companies were hired to "death march" projects (often doomed or not possible to finish). In such projects that are often a mess it's hard to do anything meaningful in short amount of time. Often to achieve a minimal change months of work were needed but clients where accuings concultancy shops of just leaching money. So Scrum was invented. Short sprint and total transparency - client is involved and we deliver anything each week / two weeks. Clients cannot now complain they do not know what is happening. Money flow is constant (Weekly or biweekly). Grim?
- Is Scrum / Agile in contradiction with technical perfection? In "Agile" methodologies one is supposed to only code what is needed now, nothing more nothing less, can this equal to technical perfection
- a bit of the book is really wordy, some of the advises are obvious like to be a better programmer one needs to read, learn, write, etc... orly?
- I'm contrasting this book with "Death March" some of conclusions are the same although Sandro is much much more optimistic
- I was surprised with a story of project manager who lies to the client about the state of the project just to say it's possible to meet the deadline. Sandro thinks one needs to only blackmail that manager that one will say the truth to the client, very strange I think this would only escalate and turn into a war
- a lot of nice things said, how to find motivation and enrgy to grow
- a very nice section about recruitment, one should look for developers with passion
- how should consultancy companies recruit? they do not have own products, technologies, processes, they are often hired to projects that are already finished and need maintenenace
- concultancy companies cannot just describe the work culture if it depends on the clients
- I have a feeling the the summary is that either consultancy companies shouldn't exist because everyone is a good craftsman and no "commando" is needed to fix shit, either concultancy companies should negotiate contracts differently and inform clients that they will deliver good code or no code. Unfortunately the market is ruthless, clients often do not have a good idea what a "good" code means and what does it mean to have "bad" code. Clients will hire the cheapest company often leading to their own doom, but it's their decision. Shitty consultancy will be hired and we are bankrupt?
- there was another interesting thing about candidates asking questions at the end of the interview. He should ask about the company? Project? etc. If he doesn't ask anything is it bad? is this a sympthom of fundamental attribution error.
